This is the repository for my personal website, built using the following technologies:

## Technologies

- [Svelte](https://svelte.dev/): A modern, component-based UI framework for building web applications.

- [Three.js](https://threejs.org/): A cross-browser JavaScript library and API used to create and display animated 3D computer graphics on the web.
- [gsplat.js](https://github.com/huggingface/gsplat.js): an easy-to-use, general-purpose, open-source 3D Gaussian Splatting library, providing functionality similar to three.js but for Gaussian Splatting.
- [GSOPs](https://github.com/david-rhodes/GSOPs): A collection of Gaussian Splatting Operators for Houdini.
- [Houdini](https://www.sidefx.com/): A powerful, efficient, and feature-rich framework for creating interactive 3D content.
- [Vercel](https://vercel.com/): A cloud platform for static sites and Serverless Functions, used for hosting and deployment.

## Features

- Interactive 3D environments and animations powered by Three.js and gsplat.js.
- Seamless deployment and hosting on Vercel.
